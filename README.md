## Introduction

This is sample code for a closed source product called 'The Body Shop' created by me for my company maxin'. The code provided here is only meant to provide some insight into the work that went into building this product and is not meant to be tested with by any means. The sample code specifically showcases the following frontend functionality of the Body Shop:

  * Trait Shop
  * Dynamic Customizer
  * Navigation
  * UI styled Components
